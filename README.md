NetSolver
=========
NetSolver is a web platform whose aim is to support students during the learning of the network concepts. In order to do so it implements a classic learning mechanism based on the proposal of problems, collecting students solution and given students feedback by sending them a report that contains the possible errors that they made.

From network requirements to a complete plan.

Network planning sequence
-------------------------

1. Front end: network requirements specification;
2. Back end: Internal network requirements specification;
3. Back end: main engine, from requirements to detailed description;
4. Back end: internal network description;
5. Front-end: display network representation (Text / Graphics / NetSimK).

Problem generation sequence
---------------------------

1. Back end: Random generation of requirements (within reasonable boundaries);
2. Front end: display requirements, ask for solution;
3. Back end: match user solution to requirements;
4. Front end: display matches / mismatches in user solution.
